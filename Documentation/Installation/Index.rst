Installation
============

Just install this extension the usual way like any other TYPO3 extension.

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. Get the extension

   In the TYPO3 backend you can use the extension manager (EM).

   .. rst-class:: bignums

   #. Switch to the module “Extension Manager”.

   #. Get the extension

   #. **Get it from the Extension Manager:**
      Press the “Retrieve/Update” button and search for the extension key
      *ns_statcounter* and import the extension from the repository.

   #. **Get it from typo3.org:** You can always get the current version from
      https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/ns_statcounter/ by downloading either
      the t3x or zip version. Upload the file afterwards in the Extension Manager.
